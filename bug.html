      <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Hi. This is Bug. This makes basically the same pattern in different colors. Every time you reset, it makes a new random background color and the color of the pattern is sort of supposed to be in line with or harmonize with the background color, but it is still randomly generated just with some parameters. I used an L system to make this, I genuinely just kept changing the rules until I liked how it looked. I don't know what the math means and could not recreate this pattern from memory or even through reverse engineering it. You can save any randomly generated image as a png. if you spam click that button on a pc it will spam download the png file, so be cautious, even though it may be a fun stim. I could have made it ask if you were sure if you wanted to save it as a png but I didn't. sorry.</p>
